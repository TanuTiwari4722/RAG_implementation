# RAG_implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that combines dense passage retrieval with generative language models. The RAG architecture enables the model to retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and generate informed, context-rich answers, making it ideal for tasks such as question answering, chatbot development, and knowledge-based generation.

* To build an end-to-end RAG pipeline using PyTorch and Sentence Transformers.
* To integrate a retriever and store embeddings with a vector database.
* To test the system on custom or benchmark datasets for evaluating performance in question answering or information synthesis tasks.

**Retriever**: Finds the most relevant documents from a corpus using vector similarity.

**Knowledge-augmented generation**: A paradigm shift from relying solely on model memory to dynamic access to external data.

**Generator**: Generates a final output using retrieved documents and a pre-trained language model.

**Workflow**
1. Loading and preprocessing of a text/document corpus.
2. Encoding and storing vector representations for retrieval.
3. Retrieval generating a vector database for storing sentence embeddings.
4. Response generation using pre-trained transformer models.
5. Custom querying interface for testing the RAG model.

**Use Case**

* Open-domain Question Answering
* Chatbots with domain-specific knowledge
* Document search and summarization
* Enterprise support systems
